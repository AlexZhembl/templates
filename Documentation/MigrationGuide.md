## Deprecated templates in 2.0 (SwiftGen 5.0) ##

The two general themes for this version are:

- Templates now reside in the subfolder corresponding to their subcommand (`colors`, `fonts`, ...) intead of the filename being prefixed with it.
- The `default` template doesn't exist anymore, templates now specify which swift version they support.
